1
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:12,495
¿Hablas español? Parlez-vous français? 你会说中文吗？

2
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:18,333
If you answered, "sí," "oui," or "会" and you're watching this in English,

3
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:23,469
chances are you belong to the world's bilingual and multilingual majority.

4
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:25,563
And besides having an easier time traveling

5
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:27,471
or watching movies without subtitles,

6
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:29,895
knowing two or more languages means that your brain

7
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:34,777
may actually look and work differently than those of your monolingual friends.

8
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:38,272
So what does it really mean to know a language?

9
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:43,133
Language ability is typically measured in two active parts, speaking and writing,

10
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,985
and two passive parts, listening and reading.

11
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:49,655
While a balanced bilingual has near equal

12
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:52,377
abilities across the board in two languages,

13
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:55,760
most bilinguals around the world know and use their languages

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,981
in varying proportions.

15
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:01,612
And depending on their situation and how they acquired each language,

16
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:04,915
they can be classified into three general types.

17
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:07,767
For example, let's take Gabriella,

18
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:12,007
whose family immigrates to the US from Peru when she's two-years old.

19
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:13,823
As a compound bilingual,

20
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:18,275
Gabriella develops two linguistic codes simultaneously,

21
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:20,297
with a single set of concepts,

22
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:22,165
learning both English and Spanish

23
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,358
as she begins to process the world around her.

24
00:01:25,358 --> 00:01:29,162
Her teenage brother, on the other hand, might be a coordinate bilingual,

25
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:31,338
working with two sets of concepts,

26
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:33,200
learning English in school,

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,764
while continuing to speak Spanish at home and with friends.

28
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:41,845
Finally, Gabriella's parents are likely to be subordinate bilinguals

29
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,410
who learn a secondary language

30
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,198
by filtering it through their primary language.

31
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:50,215
Because all types of bilingual people can become fully proficient in a language

32
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,723
regardless of accent or pronunciation,

33
00:01:52,723 --> 00:01:55,843
the difference may not be apparent to a casual observer.

34
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:58,619
But recent advances in brain imaging technology

35
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,859
have given neurolinguists a glimpse

36
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:05,714
into how specific aspects of language learning affect the bilingual brain.

37
00:02:05,714 --> 00:02:09,009
It's well known that the brain's left hemisphere is more dominant

38
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,622
and analytical in logical processes,

39
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:16,202
while the right hemisphere is more active in emotional and social ones,

40
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:20,075
though this is a matter of degree, not an absolute split.

41
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:22,883
The fact that language involves both types of functions

42
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:25,861
while lateralization develops gradually with age,

43
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:28,799
has lead to the critical period hypothesis.

44
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:30,430
According to this theory,

45
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,406
children learn languages more easily

46
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,196
because the plasticity of their developing brains

47
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,975
lets them use both hemispheres in language acquisition,

48
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:42,992
while in most adults, language is lateralized to one hemisphere,

49
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:44,898
usually the left.

50
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,684
If this is true, learning a language in childhood

51
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:52,480
may give you a more holistic grasp of its social and emotional contexts.

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,810
Conversely, recent research showed

53
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,520
that people who learned a second language in adulthood

54
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,423
exhibit less emotional bias and a more rational approach

55
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:03,811
when confronting problems in the second language

56
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:05,460
than in their native one.

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,109
But regardless of when you acquire additional languages,

58
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:12,210
being multilingual gives your brain some remarkable advantages.

59
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,754
Some of these are even visible,

60
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:16,338
such as higher density of the grey matter

61
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:19,441
that contains most of your brain's neurons and synapses,

62
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:23,504
and more activity in certain regions when engaging a second language.

63
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,889
The heightened workout a bilingual brain receives throughout its life

64
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,334
can also help delay the onset of diseases, like Alzheimer's and dementia

65
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:33,225
by as much as five years.

66
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,943
The idea of major cognitive benefits to bilingualism

67
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:37,519
may seem intuitive now,

68
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,507
but it would have surprised earlier experts.

69
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:44,194
Before the 1960s, bilingualism was considered a handicap

70
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:45,999
that slowed a child's development

71
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:50,652
by forcing them to spend too much energy distinguishing between languages,

72
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:54,089
a view based largely on flawed studies.

73
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:56,178
And while a more recent study did show

74
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:59,415
that reaction times and errors increase for some bilingual students

75
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:01,427
in cross-language tests,

76
00:04:01,427 --> 00:04:03,825
it also showed that the effort and attention needed

77
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,776
to switch between languages triggered more activity in,

78
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:11,465
and potentially strengthened, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

79
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:14,142
This is the part of the brain that plays a large role

80
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:18,971
in executive function, problem solving, switching between tasks,

81
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:22,644
and focusing while filtering out irrelevant information.

82
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:26,480
So, while bilingualism may not necessarily make you smarter,

83
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,897
it does make your brain more healthy, complex and actively engaged,

84
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:33,422
and even if you didn't have the good fortune

85
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:35,651
of learning a second language as a child,

86
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,794
it's never too late to do yourself a favor

87
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:40,572
and make the linguistic leap from, "Hello,"

88
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,559
to, "Hola," "Bonjour" or "你好’s"

89
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:48,081
because when it comes to our brains a little exercise can go a long way.
